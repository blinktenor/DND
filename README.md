# DND CharacterSheet
This project is mostly a never ending work in progress. The idea is to have a usable digital character sheet for keeping track of your chacters as time goes on without having to make all of the changes on one sheet.

## Installation
Install node.js - 4.3.1
Open a command prompt and type "npm i -g nodemon"

    -This is for node server monitor package. This will host the server and allow for changes to be made on the fly.
	
Download the codebase

Navigate in the command prompt to your directory and type "npm install"

    -This will install all necessary dependancies to run the server
	
Type "nodemon /bin/www" and your server will be up and running!
