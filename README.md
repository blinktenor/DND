# DND CharacterSheet
This project is mostly a never ending work in progress. The idea is to have a usable digital character sheet for keeping track of your chacters as time goes on without having to make all of the changes on one sheet.

## Installation
Put the project into a tomcat webapps folder. Enable php within tomcat which can be found here http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/doc/tomcat6.php

## Usage
Navigate to the tomcat hosting ip, and go to ip/DND/characterSheet.html.

Once on this page, enter your characters information, and click save. This will create a CHARACTERNAME.char.txt file for your character. When you want to return and load your character, put in that characters name and click load.
