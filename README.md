# DND CharacterSheet
This project is mostly a never ending work in progress. The idea is to have a usable digital character sheet for keeping track of your chacters as time goes on without having to make all of the changes on one sheet.

## Installation
Install node.js - 4.3.1
Open a command prompt and type "npm i -g nodemon"

    -This is for node server monitor package. This will host the server and allow for changes to be made on the fly.
	
Download the codebase

Navigate in the command prompt to your directory and type "npm install"

    -This will install all necessary dependancies to run the server
	
Type "nodemon /bin/www" and your server will be up and running!


## Usage
Navigate to localhost/DND/characterSheet.html.

Once on this page, enter your characters information, and click save. This will create a CHARACTERNAME.char.txt file for your character. When you want to return and load your character, put in that characters name and click load. 

Navigate to localhost/DND/characterSheet.html.

Once on this page, a drop down will populate for the character sheets that have been created. Select the names from the list you would like to see, then click load. The table will then populate with that character. If you would like to reload, either select that character again and click load, or click reload all. There is also a dice roller; Select the number of sides to the dice, and select how many dice with that many sides to roll, then click roll. The results will show to the right. There is also a section to store notes as you go along.
