Poison Ratings on daggers

Magic Missiles
Area of Effect: 1+ creatures in a 10 x 10 ft area
Range: 60 ft +10 ft/level
Casting Time: 1 segment
Duration: Instantaneous

When this spell is cast, missiles of magical energy dart forth from the caster’s fingertips, striking unerringly at his or her intended target(s), even if the target(s) are in melee or are partially concealed. The missiles inflict 1d4+1 points of damage each. For every two levels beyond first, the caster gains an additional missile; thus, a first-level magic-user can cast one missile, a third-level caster may cast 2, a fifth-level caster may cast 3, and so on.

Create scrolls - For each scroll created, the wizard must collect 100gp of supplies (special ink, paper, incense, etc) and pass a check (DC 15 + level of spell).

Scribe Spells - A wizard cannot access spells without copying them to their spell books. To do so requires a DC of 10 + spell level to succeed.

Disguise (+7) – used to change the appearance, station or vocation of the assassin

Intel (+4) – used to find out information from NPCs

Stealth (+5) – used to hide and move without detection

Tailing (+2) The assassin has the unique ability to follow and observe (someone) closely, especially in secret. This works just like surprise.

Make Poison (0) The assassin can create their own poisons and apply them to any surface. Roll a d20 and add the poison skill to determine how lethal the poison DC is. Anyone hit with a poison must save vs the poison lethality or die.

Pick Locks (+2) – specialization in opening things that are locked
